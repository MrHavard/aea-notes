## Notes

• Move fast, break things  
• Sole designer for SF for covid response  
• Is what you are doing the most productive thing you can be doing  
• Normalizing the stuff to achieve a goal  
• Ops - devops, designops, peopleops  
• Intraops - approach and decision making within yourself  
• Any SF employee can be pulled for 2 weeks for emergency service work  
• Make the most of wherever you find yourself (know yourself, identify your strengths)  
• Have a personal mandate - what is it you do here?  
• What is the work that only I can do?  
• What are the risks of what I'm doing and if I fail? (assess risks)  
• How do you mitigate the risks with impactful research  
• "UX Theatre" - not including users or including them just for show  
• Using research to validate bias vs challenging it  
• What does it take to make good decisions  
• Understand micro and macro views  
• What external standards and courses exist, what can you extract from the industry community  
• LOTS OF READING  
• Create community/coalitions  
• If you want to go fast go alone, far go together  
• How do you go in the right direction?  
• Stress response makes you narrow your focus (tunnel vision)  
• Tunnel vision can save your life in a dangerous response, but is not good long term and create all kinds of other problems  
• I need to finish this project vs we can solve this problem together  
• Other people are not obstacles to getting the job done  
• Understanding a problem and creating a solution should be same sized diamonds but stress will shrink the understanding part of the diamond  
• Sometimes understanding needs to be the bigger diamond  
• Make space for real people  
• Leverage the knowledge of your network  
• Honor Humanity - be aware of burnout  
• You can't meditate yourself into a supportive work environment  
• Set engagements to a fixed duration and rotate. People being involved in crisis need breaks.  
• challenge coins after emergencies  
• set sights on wider mission  
• Never panic alone  
• Leverage relationships vs pointing fingers  
  
## Reflections  
• Has a stammer like the drama team coach for Audrina's school (being inclusive)  
• What is our emergency service worker process  
• How do we look at our teams as a biological entity and how stress impacts that biology
