## Notes

* Working for Netflix password sharing project
* Patience and resilience - fall down and get back up again
* Strategy - you are the product (takes time to develop, imperfect but improving)
* IQ is important but EQ takes you the extra step
* Hard skills vs soft skill development
* Hard skills might be as little as 30% of a project and the rest is soft skills, may vary
* What impact do you want to have?
* work hard vs work smart vs out of your control
* What is a level? LOL
* What is our rubric?
* Open and honest communication, be calm though
* How does what you do help uplift everyone
* Mentorship - don't struggle alone
* Titles are important, but meaningless without understanding what do you want to do
* Mentorship is a two way street, you learn and refresh yourself
* Put yourself out there
* Be your own stakeholder - companies protect their stakeholders you protect you
* Imposter syndrome - risk trying, someone else may see you as a superhero

## Reflections

* There's a risk in exposing broken systems
