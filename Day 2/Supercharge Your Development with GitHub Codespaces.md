## Notes

* How many steps does it take from getting a new laptop to doing your work
* What happens when your equipment is slow/outdated
* mor10/gastbydemo on github
* hit punctuation in github will open webeditor
* How much can be virtualized vs having to have a high powered machine
* Many error messages to navigate just trying to get started
* Tools become accidental blockers and gatekeepers
* Hardware is expensive and not everyone can have that level of hardware
* With maturity comes complexity
* Lots of extra steps before getting to writing HTML, CSS, and JS
* What's the delta between start and coding; setup lag
* What environmental issues halt the user (permissions, security, enterprise setup, preferences)
* Cloud9, codespaces, etc
* Codespace templates with common setups
* Can control visibility from private to public; quick way to show things to client immediately
* gh codespace cli options available too
* connect with github actions for automation
* codetour? annotate code to explain what it does step by step
* templify any project
* configurable from a devcontainer.json config
* trigger codespace right from a PR!!!
* linkedinlearning on github is in codespaces
* impose consistent configuration on user but allow user preference overrides
* 60 hours free a month for a single core (.80 per compute hour) 
* What about lag and rural internet access? Digital divide
* Github eats their own dogfood
* codeswing is codepen in vscode
* persistent for 30 days (really should be temporary) only 20gb total storage
* Going back to thin clients

## Reflections

* How to do this internally with existing tools?
