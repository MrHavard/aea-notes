## Notes

* "It's so much fun to be in a room with a bunch of geeky motherfuckers"
* 90% of search words receive a single click
* Use google to understand intent (build context from search terms)
* Are you trying to get the customer to what they need or just into your funnel
* Process the clues in search terms not just try to get them into your funnel
* Don't pay for ad clicks for people who shouldn't be in your stream (i.e. "transmission" cars vs diseases)
* "Become a Librarian" vs MS Library Information Science - Speak the language of the customer
* Process the words AROUND the queries
* Intonation matters but is lost in text "Get the fuck out of here", "dude"
* Partner with direct user observation and listen to the customers
* Google provides a "refine" option after the search to help narrow the search targets
* Sometimes people are looking for images, google gives hints at what's resonating with users
* "Therapist near me" - Look at related searches at the bottom for hints of what people might really need (black therapist, female therapist, anxiety therapist, etc)
* Look at Cost Per Acquisition rising if you are not using the right language/imagery
* Black Therapist search returns pictures of white people like searching for minivan and getting roadsters
* Better help "Black Therapist" shows wall of white people
* Titles may look good to a computer but not colloquial language 
* Google autocomplete shows a list of suggestions that help you understand what's being searched for
* Terms change frequently based on events, trends, whims
* CPA when image is shown vs without
* Google can give you details about an image; Create images that align to those details to meet your users search
* Google may want a blog post vs a product page. Figure out how to direct to the right page. i.e. people may get directed to blog pages in February when searching for costumes but product pages in October
* When a company ranks at the top what else are people looking for (community, ethics, etc.)
* Scrape competitor reviews 1 & 2 star reviews and look at words
* Online ngram analyzer
* "husband and I" clue that woman is the buyer more often
* Compare CPA vs competitor pages and their keywords
* How to use search to figure out internal application user intentions i.e. Benefit tools may spawn users to look externally to find the tool or find comparable tools and info or complain about the benefits tool.
* Search using an alternate browser and use mobile which may be different from your normal default that's tailored to you specifically
* How much does it cost to build a page vs CPA
* What about indirect benefit, not conversions but brand lift in a demographic
