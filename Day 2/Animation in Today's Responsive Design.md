## Notes

* Problems in the past have been trying to fit rigid things into a flexible box
* use custom properties in keyframe animation
* Not all transforms have individual versions
* Sometimes it doesn't translate exactly
* How does the animated object know what the space it's in looks like
* Scaling animated svgs may require reducing details in the svg
* Usually requires multiple versions of the SVG
* Now can use container queries with CSS to animate the svg
* Reducing Hours to seconds of work
* container query units to know the height and width of the container
* prefers-reduced-motion (binary) 
* Be aware of triggering effects
* reduced motion can still allow for fading in place
* One-size fits all reductions are not ideal. Context is important
* view transitions api - transitions between separate pages (even not in spa)
* behind a flag in chrome today and works with reduced motion
* motion.dev - Motion One animation library follows animation api
* scroll linked animations with css or js/WAAPI 
* 12 principals of animation (Illusions of Life)
