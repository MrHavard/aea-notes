## Notes

* Staff Interaction Designer at Google
* Scope creep increases complexity and squeezes time and reduces usability and decreases understanding
* People think about fixing things by adding to something not reducing
* Fear drives scope creep
* Front-loaded instruction (carousels, tooltip tours, etc) - hard to remember, out of context, questionable value
* Tutorials may present the features as more complex than it is and deter use/learning
* Anchor information to the action in context
* Self-paced onboarding
* Integrate guidance authentically 
* Existing onboarding can be wall of text
* Treat onboarding as a journey OVER TIME not a single instance
* Better short term retention, deeper feature engagement, adoption in new markets, higher revenue
* Onboarding ends when core use begins (time to proficiency?)
* What defines core use  for your product
* Achievable for user, aligned to long term goals, specific to your product
* What's the path from start to time of core use
* STEP: Prompt, work, follow-up > connect to next step toward core path
* Onboarding is not SEPARATE from the rest of the work
* More documentation is not always the answer
* Simplify language, provide visual examples, clarify steps
* The brain shuts down when seeing overlays/popups/ads
* We don't think about how overlays are designed in relation to one another
* Overlays have accessibility issues
* Experiment with "Empty State" screens i.e. when users don't have anything on their dashboard
* Give ideas for user actions to get them started
* Hints may fade away over time or be only single use
* Create "rehearsals" where the user can try something out without breaking anything
* Build empathy for new users on your team
* Shift away from "user education" and focus on flow experience
* Tailor the experience to the user not force the user into the experience
* 

## Reflections

* How do we measure inserts/deletes for UI components
* Users are interacting with ui components daily
* Users are contributing feedback to UIC regularly (quarterly)
* Engaging support monthly
*
