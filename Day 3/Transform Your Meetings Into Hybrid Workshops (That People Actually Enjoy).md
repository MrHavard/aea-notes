## Notes

* Teams moved in person meetings to calls which don't translate for everything
* "Can't grow the company any more because remote doesn't work" at 20 people and again at 200
* Hybrid as sync/async remote/in-person (4 in box)
* Mixed modalities - sometimes meetings have a mix of in-person and remote
* In person and in sync high bandwidth and efficient
* Virtual async more flexible and more inclusive
* In person can favor social and fast thinkers
* "let's schedule a call" is the default
* What are the goals of a collaboration (what's the outcome)
* Chaos to Order - IP/IS (in person, in sync)
* Socializing - IP/IS 
* Clarifications - IP/IS miscommunication, clarity, nuance, tone
* Deliverable - S+A (sync+async)
* Getting Unstuck - "I'm stuck can you help with X"
* Updates - Async - Status updates, 25+ people audience carve out QA separately
* Knowledge Transfer - Async - Can you teach me? - Capture points of tribal knowledge to reduce repetition
* Decisions - Async - What should we do with X - takes time, should not be live. live can lead to bad decisions. Allows decisions to be documented
* Review goals regularly because things change
* Think about remote first - most inclusive - asynchronous - same process for everyone
* Serial approach - In person work shop feeds virtual workshop and then synthesize results
* Parallel - In person work shop at same time as virtual with two teams and then synthesize
* Running multiple workshops at once is difficult
* Master remote workshops first and then hybridize
* Don't create two tiers - focus on inclusivity
* Even when part of the team is on-site, split up to create equality
* Brainstorming sessions are a supplement to individual ideation
* Async does not mean just "read in advance" it should mean work someone has to do from that
* i.e. highlight topics important to you, add topics, etc. becomes an output
* Refined output should always be a draft and then a confirmation of the draft
* Divergence to give people time to think and finish activities
* Does it take more time? Yes and No; Less effort more lag
* Prep the board (the shotgun - toss everything you know out there)
* Separate as necessary  for individuals or topics
* Silent sorting give people ample time to organize/sort
* Breakout rooms based on topic and passion
* Have a plan but don't timebox things - allow organic flow of conversation
* Have some flexible agenda - may need to skip some steps if previous conversations help bypass that step
* Lean?
* Focus on an artifact as the output
* Which monthly insights to prioritize?
* Change is hard, habits usually win
* Run experiments as workflows to help people through the process, reduces fear
* Start transition in small ways
* Plan Run Review (Revert)
* No free time to read, nobody replies, schedule more calls
* loud people can be balanced by async
* Highly aligned teams will look like they don't need a lot of structure (lean) but structure is there and subtle
* https://Intenseminimalism.com
* You want something other than chat for async
* Create lean processes but give teams maximum independence, enabling inter-team comms
* Smallest possible change, start at the bottom even as an individual practice
* 

## Reflections

* Giving Chaos to Order
* From Chaos to Order
* Making Chaos from Order
* Can we set standups to async? What's the output from that? Questions?
* Socializing vs updates
