## Notes

* How do we shift from a thing oriented society to a person oriented society
* the web as a mirror where we see ourselves reflected in personalized content
* how you have to sell yourself just to have a meeting (what's in my background, how's my hair)
* rise of the idea "personal brand" is all about presenting yourself as a product
* it's about how to drive "engagement"; likes, shares, organic clicks...
* What can go wrong - all the info about you can be used for things you don't like
* Shareholders won't ask "what's the mental health of our users"
* People will engage with content they don't like MORE
* If bad information drives engagement, and engagement drives profit, bad information will win
* Blackfoot wealth is measured in generosity
* How are we making people whole in our work? See a need fill a need
* "Do you have any blockers" It's OUR job to get it out of the way
* See Native American Intellectuals like Kandiaronk
* The only way to get anything done is to convince them it's good to do vs coercion
* Encouraging good behavior on one side but incentivizing bad behavior
* Think about the land, materials, and reciprocity
* Approach to design requires system thinking
* Just world hypothesis - not supported by evidence we can see for ourselves - dehumanizes people
* Make you think your are in control of your life (libertarians)
* Not think about the whole/systems
* Contextual advertising is better than behavioral/identity advertising
* Seer's livable wage is 31% higher than market range - Wil Reynolds
* Am I a good person? "are we the baddies?"
* Am I getting closer to my values?
* What are we willing to leave money on the table for?
* By any means possible (see previous presentation)
* Interdependent Design - land, people, value - how many people did we help
* Is what we are measuring align to our core values
* What if the reflection we see is reflecting our values
* tumbler is the anti-tumbler
* You and I vs We
* What are my values, how does my work get me closer or further from, and imagine the future who have been hurt by the present
* What's OUR idea
* Consistency bias - start small and build up consistent decisions based on prior small agreements
* see red team blue team 
* Scarcity drives fear

## Reflections

* Tell the story of the Design Systems Team and how WE came together and what OUR values are
* Organic, not top down, works even as new people come on and leave, constant open communication, vulnerability
*
